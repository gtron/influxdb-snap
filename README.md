# InfluxDB snap

This is a snap of the InfluxDB time-series database.

To build it

```
 $ snapcraft
```

and install afterwards with

```
 $ snap install --dangerous influxdb_1.0.0_amd64.snap
```

You can then reach the database on http://127.0.0.1:8083

# Issues

 * Not official
 * Currently for amd64 only. Needs adding support for armhf
